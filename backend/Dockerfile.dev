# We do NOT copy source here because we will bind-mount it in docker-compose.dev.yml
# This allows you to edit files on your host and have them available in the container immediately.

# Simple development command. 
# Note: For strict hot-reloading (auto-restart on save), we would check if cargo-watch is installed.
# For now, we use 'cargo run' to start the server. 
# If you change Rust code, run 'docker compose restart backend' to recompile only changed files.
